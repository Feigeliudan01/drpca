# Differential Robust PCA

Differential PCA (dPCA) is a framework for linear component estimation in case/control studies. In our paper "Differential Principal Components Reveal Patterns of Differentiation in Case/Control Studies", we find that dPCA performs favorably compared to standard dimensionality reduction techniques while retaining extreme simlicity and ease of extensibility. Differential Robust PCA (drPCA) is one such extension. This repository contains a collection of experiments on several cancer gene expression datasets.
